## Brief summaries of the papers herein

I use the following key in terms of Tilman's "unexplored" areas of interest

 A. Diagnostics and interpretability
 B. Multi-scale modelling
 C. Estimation and heuristics
 D. Applied case studies


### Papers

#### `Coil_2012.pdf` The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe

Motivation is the large-scale clustering of galaxies. In terms of B, 'voids' and/or dark matter halos are addition structures of interest to the cluisters; however, I'm not convinced a CSCP would offer much else beyond the pcf approach used by the authours in terms of A.

#### `Iftimi_etal2018.pdf` A multi-scale area-interaction model for spatio-temporal point patterns

Motivation is a model that allows for different types of interactions between points (i.e., clustering and repulsion), which is not quite what we mean for B (i.e., two different scales of clustering) so not appropriate for C. The fous is epidemiology, cases of the Varicella–zoster virus (aka shingles). No data availabilty statement.

#### `McculMoll_2006.pdf` The Permanental Process

Another name for the CSCP, maths things defined nicely.

#### `Pei_etal2012.pdf` Multi-scale decomposition of point process data

Motivation is earthquakes, which may potentially exhibit two scales of clustering (B.). Working on getting the historic case study data (seismic records between 7 July 1961 and 8 July 1969 in the Heyuan County, Guangdong Province, China).

#### `ShiraiTakahashi_2003.pdf` Random point ﬁelds associated with certain Fredholm determinants I: fermion, Poisson and boson point processes

#### `WalderBishop_2017.pdf`

#### `YaoLoh_2012.pdf`

#### `Iftimi_etal2017.pdf`

#### `Levin_1992.pdf`

#### `Nicolis_etal2022.pdf` Temporal Cox Process with Folded Normal Intensity

Basically forces the *positivity* using a modulus. Discussion points of interest are the scale & repeating patterns/clusters. But these are over time so not really within the scope of B. 

#### `Siino_etal2017.pdf` Spatial pattern analysis using hybrid models: an application
to the Hellenic seismicity

Again earthquakes, again talking about hybrid modes (B.) but with a focus on *multi-scale interactions*.

#### `Wiegand_etal2007.pdf`
